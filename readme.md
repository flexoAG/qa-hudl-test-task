# Hudl login automation task project using Playwright TypeScript POM

I wanted to try something new, and Playwright is one of the 3 most popular test automation frameworks on the market  sharing top 3 with Selenium and Cypress.<br>

Playwright is constantly getting updates, community is growing and there always people happy to help you.<br>

I was working with TypeScript before, and I can keep using it with Playwright too.<br>

Playwright is very easy in installation and setup if I have to compare with Selenium and Cypress. It installs all needed browsers straight away in installation process, and later possible to choose which you prefer.<br>

Personally I really like codegen/Recorder feature, for easier way to get test base, for further editing. 
Inbuilt Trace feature helps a lot, when tests are failing, as it helps to see recorded video which helps with debuging.

As a still very fresh Playwright user, canâ€™t say yet, what I would improve in this framework, or what is missing.
